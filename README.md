# This is a SCRAPY Framework training project.

This code is not mine. Main goal of this project was to learn SCRAPY, Selenium, Xpath selectors, and some Splash to heavy JavaScript sites.
I uploaded this code here as a reminder for future :)
Also I realized to I would like to learn some Lua to use it with Splash browser.

Overall Scrapy is a great framework.
